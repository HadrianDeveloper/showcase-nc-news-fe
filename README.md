# NC News by Hadrian

This is the front end project for **NC News by Hadrian** - a social news aggregation, content rating and discussion web application. Anyone can get access to the articles and interactive tools, but users must be logged in to either like or comment on an article, or to remove one of their own existing comments.

## Technical overview

This application is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and deployed on Netlify. 

The backend project is located in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/HadrianDeveloper/NC-News), and has a PSQL database and ExpressJS server. The project implements the MVC framework with asynchronous code handled by Promises.

The database is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and APIs on [Render](www.render.com).
